# DoControl

## Overview

This integration allows [DoControl][9] customers to forward their DoControl-related logs and events to Datadog through automated security workflows.

## Setup

To set up this integration, you must have an active [DoControl account][10]. You must also have proper [admin permissions][11] in Datadog.

### Installation

No installation is required on your host.

### Use Datadog actions in DoControl's workflows

You must create a Datadog API key and an application key to use as input parameters for Datadog actions in DoControl.

#### Create an API key in Datadog

1. Use Datadog's [Add an API key][2] documentation to create an API key. Give the key a meaningful name such as `DoControl`.
2. Copy the `Key` and save it.


#### Create an application key in Datadog

1. Use Datadog's [Add application keys][3] documentation to create an application key.
2. Copy and save your application key.

#### Create a Datadog integration in DoControl

1. In DoControl, navigate to [Dashboard->Settings->Workflows->Secrets][4], and add your Datadog API key as a new secret.

2. Create a new Workflow from a pre-established [**playbook**][5] or from [**scratch**][6].

3. Design and edit your business logic by dragging and dropping actions onto the canvas, configuring the steps, and connecting them.

4. From the Actions bar, under **Utilities**, you can drag and drop Datadog actions into your Workflow, such as **Send logs** or **Create incident**.

5. Configure the actions to refer to the DD-API-KEY stored as a secret in Step 1 above, and the DD-APPLICATION-KEY obtained in [Create an application key in Datadog](#create-an-application-key-in-datadog).
