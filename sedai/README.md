## Overview

Sedai is an autonomous cloud platform that proactively manages production environments to prevent issues and improve availability, performance, and cloud costs. As an intelligent autopilot for SREs, Sedai independently detects, prioritizes, and analyzes monitoring data to safely and autonomously act in production without thresholds.

Enable this integration to receive notifications in Datadog about actions that Sedai autonomously executes in your production environments.

### How it Works

* **Agentless:** Seamlessly connects to your cloud accounts and automatically discovers and understands production environments.

* **Configuration-free:** Easily connects to Datadog API and intelligently identifies, prioritizes and learns metric behavior.

* **Proactive Actions:** Safely acts in production on your behalf to ensure that resources avoid availability issues and run optimally at all times.
